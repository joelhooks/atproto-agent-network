Remove AI SDK packages:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm remove ai @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider --filter @atproto-agent/network\n   ```\n\n3. Read the current ai-provider.ts:\n   ```bash\n   cat apps/network/src/ai-provider.ts\n   ```\n\n4. Write new ai-provider.ts using Pi API:\n   ```typescript\n   import { getModel, complete, type Context } from '@mariozechner/pi-ai'\n   \n   export function getOpenRouterModel(modelId: string) {\n     return getModel('openrouter', modelId)\n   }\n   \n   export async function completeWithOpenRouter(\n     model: string,\n     context: Context,\n     options?: { tools?: any[] }\n   ) {\n     const model_obj = getOpenRouterModel(model)\n     return complete(model_obj, context, options)\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Read the current agent-factory.ts:\n   ```bash\n   cat apps/network/src/agent-factory.ts\n   ```\n\n6. Rewrite agent-factory.ts to use Pi:\n   - Replace all imports from 'ai' with imports from '@mariozechner/pi-ai'\n   - Replace generateText() calls with complete() calls\n   - Keep the factory function signature the same\n   - Maintain OpenRouter + CF AI Gateway routing\n\n7. Run tests to verify:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm test 2>&1 | tail -5\n   ```\n\n8. Run typecheck:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm typecheck\n   ```\n\nSuccess criteria:\n- All 86 tests pass\n- No imports from 'ai' package remain\n- Agent factory returns working prompt() function\n- Typecheck clean",

      "title": "Agent factory o11y — full think prompt, loop transcript, and timing",
      "description": "Add comprehensive observability to the agentic tool loop in agent-factory.ts and expose it via the debug endpoint.\n\nThree things to instrument:\n\n1. **Full think prompt storage** — Store the complete messages array sent to OpenRouter in DO storage at `debug:lastPrompt`. Include system prompt + conversation history + tool definitions. Truncate if >100KB but preserve the system prompt and last 3 messages minimum. Expose via GET /agents/:name/debug as `lastPrompt`.\n\n2. **Agentic loop transcript** — In the multi-turn tool loop in `prompt()` (agent-factory.ts), record each step as an array entry:\n   ```ts\n   interface LoopStep {\n     step: number;\n     timestamp: number;\n     durationMs: number;\n     modelResponse?: { role: string; content?: string; toolCalls?: any[] };\n     toolResults?: { name: string; durationMs: number; result: any }[];\n   }\n   ```\n   Store the full transcript array in DO storage at `debug:loopTranscript`. Expose via GET /agents/:name/debug as `loopTranscript`.\n\n3. **Timing per step** — Each model call and each tool execution gets `performance.now()` before/after. Total loop duration stored at `debug:loopDurationMs`.\n\nImplementation notes:\n- All debug data written to DO storage via `this.state.storage.put()` in agent.ts after the think/act cycle completes\n- The factory `prompt()` method should return the transcript alongside the existing response (add it to the return value or store on the factory instance)\n- Debug endpoint in index.ts already reads from DO storage — extend it to include new fields\n- Keep backward compat — existing debug fields (lastThinkRaw, lastOpenRouterReq, autoPlay) remain\n\nFiles: `apps/network/src/agent-factory.ts`, `apps/network/src/agent.ts`, `apps/network/src/index.ts`, `apps/network/src/agent-do.test.ts`\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- GET /agents/:name/debug returns lastPrompt (messages array), loopTranscript (step array with timing), loopDurationMs\n- Each tool execution in the loop has its own durationMs\n- Existing debug fields still present",
