## Search Tips

- **Use `--expand 2000`** to get full context paragraphs, not just snippets
- **Be specific** — "goblin ambush tactics" beats "monster fights"
- **Search by book concepts** — the library has a taxonomy of concepts like `design/monster-tactical-behavior`, `design/player-combat-strategy`, `design/combat-encounter-design`
- **Combine sources** — check "Monsters Know" for how monsters fight, then "Live to Tell" for how players counter it
- **OSE for tables** — whenever you need random generation (encounters, treasure, dungeons), search OSE first
