Codex: Starting story-mlfbhwfc: I’m going to (1) run the required `swarm memory find` for this story topic, then (2) add a failing unit test in `apps/network/src/agent-do.test.ts` covering finished games, and only then (3) patch `apps/network/src/agent.ts` for the query + debug fields and run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`.

Codex: Starting story-mlfbhwfc. First step: run the required `swarm memory find` for this story topic, then I’ll write a failing test in `apps/network/src/agent-do.test.ts` before patching the query + debug object in `apps/network/src/agent.ts` and running `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`.

Codex: I’m going to (1) pull any hivemind memories for this story topic, then (2) write a failing unit test around active-game detection in the AgentDO alarm/observe cycle, and only then (3) patch apps/network/src/agent.ts until the tests pass.

Completed: Fix autoPlay — filter by game type and skip finished/abandoned games
Files: apps/network/src/agent.ts, apps/network/src/environments/catan.ts, .ralph-context.json, .ralph-iterations.jsonl, prd.json, progress.txt
Summary: Starting story-mlfbhwfc: I’m going to (1) run the required `swarm memory find` for this story topic, then (2) add a failing unit test in `apps/network/src/agent-do.test.ts` proving finished/abandoned games don’t inject game context, and only then (3) patch `apps/network/src/agent.ts` for the query + debug field and run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` (in two steps to avoid timeouts).
