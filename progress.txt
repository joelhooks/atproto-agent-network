# atproto-agent-network Progress

## Project Overview
Private-by-default encrypted memory network for AI agents on AT Protocol.
GitHub: joelhooks/atproto-agent-network (31 issues, proper labels)

## Critical Rules
1. TDD IS THE LAW - Write tests FIRST
2. GitHub issues are source of truth - prd.json syncs from them
3. Private by default - all memories encrypted
4. Check CONTEXT.md before starting any work

## Current State
- Monorepo structure: COMPLETE (turbo, pnpm, packages)
- Vitest: installed but needs workspace config
- Crypto primitives: stubs exist in packages/core/src/crypto.ts
- Tests: need to be written

## Completed Issues
- #6 Setup monorepo - DONE (structure exists)

## Next Up (from prd.json)
- #24 Install Vitest root config
- #25 First unit test for identity.ts
- #26 Vitest workspace config
- #27 Turbo test task

Completed: Install Vitest and create root config
Files: none
Summary: **Summary**
Vitest is already installed and the root config exists (`package.json`, `vitest.config.ts`), so no code changes were needed for this story. Validation passes.

**Tests**
