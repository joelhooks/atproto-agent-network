Codex: Starting story-mlfbhwfc: I’m going to (1) run the required `swarm memory find` for this story topic, then (2) add a failing unit test in `apps/network/src/agent-do.test.ts` covering finished games, and only then (3) patch `apps/network/src/agent.ts` for the query + debug fields and run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`.
