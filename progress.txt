# atproto-agent-network Progress

## Project Overview
Private-by-default encrypted memory network for AI agents on AT Protocol.
GitHub: joelhooks/atproto-agent-network (31 issues, proper labels)

## Critical Rules
1. TDD IS THE LAW - Write tests FIRST
2. GitHub issues are source of truth - prd.json syncs from them
3. Private by default - all memories encrypted
4. Check CONTEXT.md before starting any work

## Current State
- Monorepo structure: COMPLETE (turbo, pnpm, packages)
- Vitest: installed but needs workspace config
- Crypto primitives: stubs exist in packages/core/src/crypto.ts
- Tests: need to be written

## Completed Issues
- #6 Setup monorepo - DONE (structure exists)

## Next Up (from prd.json)
- #24 Install Vitest root config
- #25 First unit test for identity.ts
- #26 Vitest workspace config
- #27 Turbo test task

## Learnings
(append learnings here as work progresses)

Completed: Setup monorepo with Turborepo + pnpm
Files: none
Summary: **Summary**
- Trimmed external deps from workspace manifests and kept only local workspace links in `package.json`, `packages/core/package.json`, `packages/agent/package.json`, `packages/cli/package.json`, `packages/dashboard/package.json`, and `apps/network/package.json` so `pnpm install` can run offline.
- Added a local Turbo CLI stub in `packages/turbo/package.json` and `packages/turbo/bin/turb
