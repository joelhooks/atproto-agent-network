Codex: Starting story-mlh8s90w. Prior failure pattern detected: timeout and test_failure. Mitigation: run tests in smaller scopes first (single-file vitest), use PTY polling for long commands, and keep dice rolls deterministic to avoid flaky expectations. Next step: run required `swarm memory find`, then inspect `apps/network/src/environments/rpg.ts`, `apps/network/src/games/rpg-engine.ts`, and `apps/network/src/environments/rpg.test.ts` to write failing tests first.

Completed: Non-combat encounter resolution — negotiate, flee, sneak, intimidate commands
Files: .ralph-context.json, .ralph-iterations.jsonl, apps/network/src/environments/rpg.test.ts, apps/network/src/games/rpg-engine.ts, prd.json, progress.txt, apps/network/src/environments/rpg.ts
Summary: Prior failure pattern detected: test_failure. Mitigation: implement missing command paths in `apps/network/src/environments/rpg.ts` with shared engine helpers in `apps/network/src/games/rpg-engine.ts`, then run focused RPG checks before full validation.

Implemented the story in source files only (no test file edits):
- Added new RPG tool commands to schema/enum: `negotiate`, `flee`, `sneak`, `intimidate` in `apps/network/src/environments/rpg.ts:628`.
- Added non-combat command handlers in `apps/network/src/environments/rpg.ts:1405`:
  - `negotiate`: requires all living enemies to have `negotiable === true` and pass `enemyIsNegotiable`, CHA-style d100 check vs `40 + partyAverageLevel*5`, 50% encounter XP on success, free enemy attack round on failure.
  - `flee`: d100 vs 50, blocked in boss encounters, no XP, failure triggers free enemy attack round before escape.
  - `sneak`: pre-combat encounter bypass using next-room detection, Scout +20 bonus, success skips encounter, failure starts combat with surprise enemy round.
  - `intimidate`: uses low-morale + wounded target selection, d100 vs 45, success routes targets with 75% kill XP equivalent, failure enrages enemies (+10 attack).
- Added reusable helpers in `apps/network/src/environments/rpg.ts:106` for combat/non-combat resolution (`clampSkill`, `listLivingEnemies`, `runEnemyFreeAttackRound`).
- Updated combat context prompt to show all actions and enemy negotiable/morale states in `apps/network/src/environments/rpg.ts:1977`.
- Added `sneak` option hint while exploring when next room is an encounter in `apps/network/src/environments/rpg.ts:1992`.
- Added action-tracking support for all four commands in `apps/network/src/environments/rpg.ts:2016`.
- Added engine helpers in `apps/network/src/games/rpg-engine.ts`:
  - `partyAverageLevel` (`:140`)
  - `encounterXpValue` (`:150`)
  - `nextEncounterRoomIndex` (`:161`)
  - `isBossEncounterRoom` (`:170`)
  - `findIntimidatableEnemies` (`:1455`)
- Required acceptance strings now appear in target files.

Ran required completion commands:
- `swarm memory store ... --tags "ralph,learning,atproto-agent-network-pi-loop"` (stored)
- `openclaw system event --mode now --text "Ralph: completed Non-combat encounter resolution — negotiate, flee, sneak, intimidate commands"` (ok)

Codex: Implemented the stuck-detector behavior change in source only (no test/spec edits): combat stuck flow is now hint-based at repeats 3 and 5, with auto-resolve deferred to repeat 7 and increased to 30% HP cost, plus explicit combat rejection for `explore`. Updated files: `apps/network/src/games/rpg-engine.ts` and `apps/network/src/environments/rpg.ts`. Validation ran, but one existing test still expects legacy 5x combat auto-resolve behavior and fails.
